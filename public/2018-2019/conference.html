        <p>The Annual National Cognitive Science Conference is organized by the UC San Diego Cognitive Science Student Association. In this 12th year, our theme, <strong>The Cognitive Revolution 2.0</strong>, considers a new frontier in our field engendered by the growing popularity of practical applications. The 1950’s Cognitive Revolution led to the foundation of this interdisciplinary field, of which the UCSD Cognitive Science department has been a leader. In thinking of the future of our field, we highlight two core values: innovation and inclusivity. Today, our field is ideally positioned to make major impact in varied areas such as technology development, clinical applications, education, and entertainment. It also has the potential to help overcome cognitive biases and improve the lives of those who are disabled or in need/disadvantaged.

            <h3>Talk Title: From Frogs' Brains to the Language of Buildings. </br><a href="arbib.pdf">Slides<i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></h3>
            <p> Michael A. Arbib has held Emeritus status (since August 2016) as University Professor, Fletcher Jones Professor of Computer Science, as well as a Professor of Biological Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Neuroscience and Psychology at the University of Southern California, which he joined in September of 1986. He is currently an Adjunct Professor of Psychology at the University of California at San Diego. The thrust of his work is expressed in the title of his first book, Brains, Machines and Mathematics (McGraw-Hill, 1964): the brain is not a computer in the current technological sense, but he has based his career on the argument that we can learn much about machines from studying brains, and much about brains from studying machines.

            <p> Dr. Nitz is a professor at the UCSD Cognitive Science department. In 1988, he started to work at The Neurosciences Institute in San Diego with Giulio Tononi and Gerald Edelman, where he had his own very first small laboratory and began work on cortical representation of spatial information. He finished his PhD at UCLA Neuroscience Program in 1995 and took a post-doctoral position with Bruce McNaughton at the University of Arizona. There, he learned to apply the neuroscience methodology, recording of multiple single neurons in behaving animals, that still dominates his work today and which, for him, is the most revealing of brain function as it relates to information processing.

            <p>Dr. Lara Maria Rangel received a B.S. in Biological Sciences from Stanford University in 2006 and a Ph.D. in Neurosciences from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 2012. She conducted her postdoctoral work in the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, based at Boston University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she investigated the rhythmic coordination of neural spiking activity in the rodent hippocampus. In 2015, she became a UC Chancellor’s Postdoctoral Fellow at UCSD, and began investigating the relationship between local circuit level processes in the brain and extracranially measured brain rhythms. Her research tests whether rhythmic activity is important for coordinating the processing of information in organized networks of neurons. Her goal is to provide new insight into the single cell interactions underlying the occurrence of brain rhythms measured in rodents and humans</p>

            <p>Talk Title: “Uncovering the brain mechanisms of risk and resilience: Social and emotional functioning in children with mental health disorders”
             Bio: Jillian Lee Wiggins, Ph.D. is a developmental psychologist who received her Ph.D. from University of Michigan in 2013. At the University of Michigan, Dr. Wiggins’ research focused on identifying the brain and genetic mechanisms of socio-emotional functioning (for example, social interaction with other people, reading people’s emotions, reacting to people’s facial expressions) in youth with autism spectrum disorder as well as typically developing youth. To do this, she used neuroscience tools (functional MRI, functional connectivity, genotyping) to link brain activation patterns in response to emotional faces to genetic variation in children and adolescents with and without autism. After completing her PhD, Dr. Wiggins joined the Emotion and Development Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health/National Institutes of Health (NIMH/NIH) as a post-doctoral fellow. At the NIH, Dr. Wiggins’ work examined brain mechanisms of processing socio-emotional stimuli (i.e., faces) in youth with severe irritability and bipolar disorder.
