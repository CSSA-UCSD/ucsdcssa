            <h2> Jillian Lee Wiggins</h2>
            <p>Talk Title: “Uncovering the brain mechanisms of risk and resilience: Social and emotional functioning in children with mental health disorders”
             Bio: Jillian Lee Wiggins, Ph.D. is a developmental psychologist who received her Ph.D. from University of Michigan in 2013. At the University of Michigan, Dr. Wiggins’ research focused on identifying the brain and genetic mechanisms of socio-emotional functioning (for example, social interaction with other people, reading people’s emotions, reacting to people’s facial expressions) in youth with autism spectrum disorder as well as typically developing youth. To do this, she used neuroscience tools (functional MRI, functional connectivity, genotyping) to link brain activation patterns in response to emotional faces to genetic variation in children and adolescents with and without autism. After completing her PhD, Dr. Wiggins joined the Emotion and Development Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health/National Institutes of Health (NIMH/NIH) as a post-doctoral fellow. At the NIH, Dr. Wiggins’ work examined brain mechanisms of processing socio-emotional stimuli (i.e., faces) in youth with severe irritability and bipolar disorder.
